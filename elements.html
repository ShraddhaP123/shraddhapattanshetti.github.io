										<h3>Abstract</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>Improvements in technology have led to
												digitalization. Chatbots have become significant when it comes
												to transformation driven by mobility. Chatbots are meant to
												have interaction with humans. The conversation might take
												place in terms of speech and text inputs. There are varieties of
												chatbots implemented based on the complexity of human
												questions. Chatbots are being implanted in a variety of areas
												like HealthCare, Marketing, Entertainment, Education and so
												on. Because of its massive usage, it becomes significant to look
												after the usability of chatbots. People using chatbots will look
												for improvised features like reduced response time, user
												experience, consistent reply, relevancy, accuracy and precision,
												Multi-lingual, personalization, increased efficiency. So, the
												main intention behind this paper is to provide insights
												regarding amelioration done in chatbots in various areas. The
												research paper provides in-depth information regarding
												limitations and heuristics followed to improve the usability of
												chatbots in various aspects. In addition to this, Performance
												metrics on which chatbots are evaluated are included</p>

										<h3>Abstract</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>A computer vision technique that has fascinated the world with its outstanding ability to localize and identify objects is Object recognition. It draws bounding boxes around the recognized objects and accurately labels them. Object detection is more intricate than classification as it not only recognizes the object but also the location of the object in the image. A widely known algorithm for precise and quick detection is YOLO. YOLO (You only look once) is an open-source and reliable real-time object recognition algorithm that can identify multiple objects in a single frame. Furthermore, it recognizes objects more rapidly and precisely than other recognition systems. It is one of the best and adaptable computer vision algorithms because it can process 45 frames per second and can estimate up to 9000 and more seen and unseen classes of objects. It is also seen that YOLO works faster than RCNN, due to its elementary architecture. Antithetical to R-CNN algorithms that use regions to circumscribe the entities in images, YOLO instead applies neural network to the complete image to anticipate bounding boxes and their probabilities. YOLOv4 is finer than YOLOv3 in terms of Adequate Speed and Accuracy of Object Recognition.</p>
